<p>Select what CSS to generate: border or outline and set your
preferences:</p>
<p>There are many ways to customize CSS border styles. The most
important being the thickness, its color and the style: solid, dotted,
dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset.</p>
Set the color transparency for the line surrounding the object and
finally the position. Draw the line above, on the right, on the left
or only below the HTML element. Round the four corners setting up a
uniform border radius or individual values for each corners. Get your
code compressed in one line or each property separated.
Border Outline CSS Designer
Beside borders,
 you can generate CSS outline styles that work similar. Setting border
to an element pushes other sections away on the page, while the
outline behaves like some kind of box shadow that surrounds the piece
but doesn't push it away. Set the outline with the same controls. In
this case the border-position and border-radius properties are not
available, but the outline-offset comes in that specifies the distance
between the edge of the element and the surrounding line.
Go ahead and experiment with this free online border and outline
generator! Drag the sliders, press the buttons and pick the colors
until you are satisfied with the result!
